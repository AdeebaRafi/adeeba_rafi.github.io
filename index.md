## About Me

I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Hazara University, KPK, Pakistan in September 2024. I believe in consistency. I aim to improve at least 1% every day by learning something new.

Outside of tech, I love playing badminton because it keeps me active and fresh. I’m also trying to build a habit of reading. Currently I am reading the book *Think and Grow Rich*, and yes, I’m still on chapter 3. (Still working to build my habit of reading books :)  
I also enjoy designing social media posters and visual content.

## Research Interests
- Computer Science  
- Artificial Intelligence  
- Machine Learning  
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  
- Robotics
- Software Engineering

## Coding Competitions
I love competing not to win every time, but to keep learning. Every challenge teaches me something new, and I show up consistently because that’s how I grow.

- **CS50 Puzzle Day Winner:** Solved all 9 puzzles in the event hosted by Harvard University  
- **MIT Winter Coding Contest 2025:** Ranked 133rd out of 536 teams globally  
- **UC Berkeley Coding Competition:** Qualified  
- **Advent of Code 2024:** Completed all 25 days of challenges

## Teaching & Volunteer Experience
Taught Python and C++ to 100+ underprivileged students, helping them understand basic concepts and build a strong foundation.

As a graphic designer, I’ve created posters and event visuals for my university since 2020 to help make STEM feel more engaging and creative.

## Leadership
- Led multiple hackathon teams, guiding idea execution, task division, and presentations
- Organized and hosted webinars and seminars at university to help peers learn new tech trends
- Assisted students during STEM exhibitions by helping them with setup, presentations, and audience interaction
- Regularly help classmates and juniors with project guidance and academic questions
- Volunteer mentor for coding workshops and campus events
- Contributed as a core team member in university societies, helping with event planning and coordination
